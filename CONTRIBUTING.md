## Grunt

### Developing
There are two development tasks included in the Gruntfile. Both will watch for changes, one for less
and one for sass. They both also include LiveReload by default, install the [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei/related)
to enable it.

**LESS**

```bash
$ grunt dev:less
```

**SASS**
```bash
$grunt dev:scss
```

**Grunt!** Ok... when you edit something please run `grunt` to compile CSS and copy stuff in the correct folders. Thanks!
